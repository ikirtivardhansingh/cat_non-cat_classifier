# cat_non-cat_classifier

## In this project I have used Neural Network Implementation of Image classifier with multiple hidden layers. 
##Here I have taken two datsets:
"test_catvnoncat.h5" as test dataset and "train_catvnoncat.h5" as train dataset and used logistic regression to classify whether an image is of a cat or non cat.
